# Power-Prediction-using-Gradient-Descent

Power Prediction using Regression ML model with Gradient Descent Optimization technique

•This project aims to build a machine learning model in order to predict power consumption used in a
combined cycle power plant . Since the output or predicted variable is a continuous variable , standard
regression techniques are being used .

•The ML model that we build also utilizes feature scaling to improve accuracy . The feature scaling is
done through standard ML library known as Scikit learn .
